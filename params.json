It's not a thing. It's this guy:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.\r\n\r\nNot every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g yo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Yeoman Generators\r\n\r\nYeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.\r\n\r\nTo install generator-go-static from npm, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g generator-go-static\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, initiate the generator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yo go-static\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, add a page or post:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yo go-static:post \"New Blog Post\"\r\n$ yo go-static:page \"About\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
