[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) to scaffold out your project and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to generate the output.\r\n\r\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/generator-go-static.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/generator-go-static)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nGo Static! depends on Yeoman, so make sure you have it installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g yo\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have Yeoman installed, you can install Go-Static! with NPM:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g generator-go-static\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Go-Static! installed, you can now initialize your working directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir my-blog && cd $_\r\n$ yo go-static\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating your first post\r\n\r\nIf everything intialized correctly, you can now use Go-Static! to create your posts for you.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yo go-static:post\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will be presented with some questions regarding the post, such as title, snippet, tags, etc. If everything went ok,\r\nit will generate a report of exactly what was generated for you.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to write just posts, you can create pages also:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yo go-static:page\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The build step\r\n\r\nOnce your pages and posts are created, it's time to generate the output and serve it up.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grunt server\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the <code>server</code> Grunt task will <code>build</code> and <code>watch</code> your code for changes.\r\nIf you prefer to just run the build step, just run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grunt build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n### Full Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation isn't completed as this is a work in progress, but there are a couple pages to help you understand some of the basics.\r\n\r\n[Go-Static! Wiki](https://github.com/colynb/generator-go-static/wiki/_pages)\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nGo-Static! has just been born and still needs work to be awesome.
