### Create a New Page

Creating a page with Go-Static! is just as simple [Creating a post](/posts/create-new-post.html). Like creating a post, there are a couple ways to do it: either let the built in Yeoman generator scaffold out a new page for you, or you can just create a new file yourself in your favorite editor.

#### The Yeoman generator way

If you're using Go-Static! for the first time, this is a good way to go. Just run the generator for creating posts and follow the prompts.

```
$ yo go-static:page
```

The generator creates a new file (currently the default uses Markdown).

The file will contain "front matter" section at the top. This is a way to store all the meta details about the page. You can read more about Go-Static! front matter in the documentation.

For instance, the typical front matter for a page looks like:

```
layout: page
title: About Us
path: /about.html
type: page
created: '2013-09-20T19:28:35-07:00'
```

The generator creates this for you. Add your content below that section.

#### Manually creating a post

As you can see, Go-Static isn't magic. It simply uses Yeoman to automate the creation of posts, a step that can easily be done manually by you. Just create a new file with some meta details about the page, then run your build.
